# OARC Multiplayer Spawn
A Factorio mod for allowing separate spawn locations in multiplayer. Designed for Co-op and PvE. 

## WORK IN PROGRESS
This is the currently in development branch for Factorio V2.0. It is not yet complete. If you want a stable version, please use the latest release.

## Read the WIKI
The github wiki page will have the most up to date information. If you have questions, go there first, otherwise just ask.

## Versions
Check releases for stable versions.  
2.0.X WILL BE the currently in work version that will support Factorio V2.0 with and without the Space Age expansion.  
1.1.X is the latest stable version for V1.0 that I plan to do minimal maintenance on.  
0.17 and 0.16 have final stable versions that will no longer be maintained.  

## Status
Currently working on adding support for V2.0 Factorio.  
Will be removing many of the soft-mod features and other feature creep things for the first version.  
Waiting on Space Age release so I can start working on support for that.

Feel free to submit bugs/fixes/requests/pulls/forks whatever you want.

I do not plan on supporting PvP, but I will help anyone who wants to make it a configurable option.
