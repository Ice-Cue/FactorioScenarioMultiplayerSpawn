4. Go through separate spawns code carefully and make sure it can support MULTIPLE SURFACES!
8. Add multiple surfaces to Spawn GUI (Drop down selection?)
9. Add multiple surfaces to all core code
10. Check and update all functions using surfaces to clearly use either the LuaSurface obj OR a string name.
11. Expose more config options in admin GUI
12. Tooltips for GUI elements in spawn menu options!
13. Change Near/Far buttons to radio selection w/ text explanation and have a single Spawn button.
14. Configurable welcome/server messages in admin GUI.

Other Ideas, Not Committed:
Add option to spawn on existing chunks (look for chunks with any entities in them, or use regrowth logic)
Add option for spawn pen to be on a specified surface
Change "search for ungenerated spawn point" to be a "roll" button that the player can re-roll? Maybe it shows on the map in an icon where they might go first?
Make players join a "holding_pen" force instead of the main force? Might cause issues with chat and vision?

1. (DONE) First setup the mod settings and lua global settings.
2. (DONE) Test out removing the creation of a custom surface and ensure map settings can be set as needed. Possibly create a separate surface, or just a separate area away from the origin, for starting players.
3. (DONE) Start copying in the core pieces required for the primary spawning mechanic.
5. (DONE) Document config and mod settings using Lua annotation as a custom class
6. (DONE) Document global ocore as a custom class (with subclasses/types as needed)
7. (DONE) Add multiple surfaces to options/settings [As a single boolean.]

(DONE) Figure out how to define custom lua table/data structs to make syntax/linting work?
