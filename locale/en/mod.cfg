oarc-welcome-msg=Welcome message printed to players.
oarc-server-rules=Server rules and info text.
oarc-server-contact=Server Contact Info

oarc-server-owner-is-oarc=Test setting. Don't use this for yourself.
oarc-enable-vanilla-spawns=Enabling this creates the default game style starting points that can then be assigned to players after the game starts. This DISABLES the normal fixed layout spawning. A lot of the other settings will NOT apply if using the vanilla spawn mode!
oarc-enable-buddy-spawn=Allows 2 players to spawn together, next to each other on the map. Not compatible with vanilla spawns for obvious reasons.
oarc-frontier-rocket-silo=Disables player's ability to build a rocket silo. Instead creates them on the map for all forces to find and use.
oarc-silo-islands=Forces the island map preset and assigns a silo area to every other island. Only usable with vanilla spawns and frontier silo mode enabled.
oarc-enable-undecorator=Removes decorative entities from the map. Helps on save file size.
oarc-enable-tags=Enables an in-game GUI menu for selecting optional player tags.
oarc-enable-long-reach=My own version of long reach. Don't use this if you have a long reach mod.
oarc-enable-autofill=My own version of autofill. Don't use this if you have a long reach mod.

oarc-list-offline-players=Shows offline players in player list.
oarc-enable-shared-team-vision=Makes all teams have shared vision.

oarc-enable-abandoned-base-removal=If a player leaves within a short amount of time (configurable), their base and surrounding chunks will be deleted.
oarc-enable-research-queue=Enables research queue by default for all forces/teams.
oarc-enable-lock-goodies=Locks a few tech and recipes like power armor mk2, artillery, nukes, speed and prod modules mk3 until you launch a rocket.
oarc-modified-enemy-spawning=I have tweaked enemy spawning around player starting areas to make it balanced and playable.
oarc-near-dist-start=Closest possible distance in chunks for a "near" spawn.
oarc-near-dist-end=Furthest possible distance in chunks for a "near" spawn.
oarc-far-dist-start=Closest possible distance in chunks for a "far" spawn.
oarc-far-dist-end=Furthest possible distance in chunks for a "far" spawn.
oarc-vanilla-spawn-count=Number of vanilla spawn points generated. Safe to set very high.

oarc-water-y-offset=Y-Offset for water tiles position.

oarc-resource-rand-pos-enabled=Enable "auto" placement of resources in the base. As opposed to fixed positions. Also randomizes order of resources a bit. I RECOMMEND NOT DISABLING THIS, mod version does not allow for specifiying fixed resource locations!!
oarc-resource-rand-pos-radius=Radius of the circle on which resources are placed in the base.
oarc-resource-rand-pos-angle-offset=Starting angle in radians at which the first resource is placed.
oarc-resource-rand-pos-angle-final=Final angle in radians at which the last resource is placed.
