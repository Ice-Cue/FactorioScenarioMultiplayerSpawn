[mod-description]
oarc-mod=This is a multiplayer mod that allows every player to create their own spawn point when they join the game. There are a lot of helpful features to ensure that new players can join at anytime in the game or even join other player's spawn areas.\n\n[color=red][font=default-bold]Please check out the github page and discord for more information and support.[/font][/color]\n\n[font=italic]This USED to be available as a scenario, but now is only provided as a mod. The scenario included in this mod only provides a way to overwrite the default freeplay scenario. It also provides a way for experienced server hosts to configure settings from a file instead of through the usual mod settings. Please read the control.lua file inside the scenario for notes.[/font]

oarc-mod-minimum-online-time=The minimum time a player must be online before they leave, otherwise their spawn area will be cleaned up.
oarc-mod-respawn-cooldown-min=The minimum time a player must wait before they can change their spawn point to a new location.

oarc-mod-enable-regrowth=Enables regrowth. This slowly removes inactive chunks over time. Any chunk with player structures will not be removed. This helps to keep the map (and file size) smaller over time.
oarc-mod-enable-world-eater=Enables world eater. This is requires and is part of regrowth. This slowly checks all chunks for a lack of player structures and entities and marks them for removal. This helps to keep the map (and file size) smaller over time. This is more of an experimental feature, use at your own risk.
