oarc-mod-scenario-config-note=[color=red]This is not an actual mod setting![/color]\n It is just a note regarding further customization available:\n Additional settings can be found in the scenario config file.

oarc-mod-enable-main-team=Allow players to join a "main team" with all other players.\n[font=default-bold]You must enable one or both of the main team and separate team options. Otherwise it will default to main team allowed only.[/font][/color]

oarc-mod-enable-spawning-on-other-surfaces=Allow spawning on other surfaces.
oarc-mod-enable-regrowth=Enables regrowth. This slowly removes inactive chunks over time. Any chunk with player structures will not be removed. This helps to keep the map (and file size) smaller over time.

oarc-mod-enable-force-bridges-next-to-moats=If spawn is surrounded by land, the moat will have a small land bridge connecting it.
